the probability of picking index i is `w[i] / sum(w)`

which means the current sum of i to the i-1's distance  
is the probability of their different/sum(w)

thus, by calculating the presum of each i index and  
choosing a random value out of the sum(w) can determine  
the picked range of the presum[i]

    sum = 0;
    presum = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum += w[i];
        presum[i] = sum;
    }
}

public int pickIndex() {
    double target = Math.random() * sum;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (target < presum[i])
            return i;
    }
