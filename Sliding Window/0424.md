- [340. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters](0340.md)
- [1004. Max Consecutive Ones III](1004.md)

<br>

### Question

> Choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character and perform this operation at most k times. Return the longest substring.

Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1  
Output: 4  
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".  
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.

### Intuition

- The only thing need to know from the current window is the max occurrence
- as long as the window size have only k replacements needed, update the current max
- if it exceeds k replacements, shrink the window by one

**`maxFreqChar`**

- if the maxFreqChar's occurrence did not occur within the distance of k, it will be removed before recalculating the max freq char
- thus, the maxFreqChar is always the current most frequent occurence in the current window

### Code

**Time:** O(n)  
**Space:** O(26) = O(1)

```java
public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
    int [] window = new int[26];

    int ans = 0;
    int maxFreqChar = 0;
    int left = 0, right = 0;

    while (right < s.length()) {
        char c = s.charAt(right++);
        window[c-'A']++;
        maxFreqChar = Math.max(maxFreqChar, window[c-'A']);

        // it's only to shrink the window by one
        // so we can make at most k replacements
        if (right-left-maxFreqChar  > k)  {
            c = s.charAt(left++);
            window[c-'A']--;
        }
        ans = Math.max(ans, right-left);
    }

    return ans;
}
```
