### Question

> Given two nodes of a binary tree p and q, return their lowest common ancestor (LCA).

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1  
Output: 3  
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

<br>

### Intuition

Iterative:

Given only the node at p and q, but not root of the tree. And every node we can get its parent node.

1. while two nodes intersect, it's the lowest common ancestor
2. similar to 160, if either became null (means reaching the root node) switch to the other starting node

### Code

**Time:** O(n)  
**Space:** O(1)

Iterative

```java
public Node lowestCommonAncestor(Node p, Node q) {
    Node a = p, b = q;
    while (a != b) {
        a = a == null ? q:a.parent;
        b = b == null ? p:b.parent;
    }
    return a;
}
```
