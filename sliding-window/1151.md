## Question

> Given a binary array data, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1â€™s present in the array together in any place in the array.

Input: data = \[1,0,1,0,1]\
Output: 1\
Explanation: There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:\
\[1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.\
\[0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.\
\[0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.\
The minimum is 1.

## Intuition

Thinking this way, instead of counting the swaps, the goal is to find a subarray with most 1s. So, to expand and shrink the window, we need to check if the ones in the current window is greater than the preivous subarrays.

But what's the boundary in terms of array length?\
The minimum of swaps is **0**, if all 1's are continguous

1. count the number of 1's in the input array
2. keep window ones max
   - if the window size = totalOnes, check the maximum ones in current window
   - and shrink the window by leftmost element so the next window gets the same size
3. return the total ones - max ones window is the number of swaps

## Code

**Time:** O(n)\
**Space:** O(1)

```java
public int minSwaps(int[] data) {
    int ones = 0;
    for (int d: data)
        ones += d;

    int windowOne = 0;
    int maxOne = 0;

    int left = 0, right = 0;
    while (right < data.length) {
        windowOne += data[right++];
        if (right-left == ones) {
            maxOne = Math.max(maxOne, windowOne);
            windowOne -= data[left++];
        }
    }

    return ones - maxOne;
}
```
