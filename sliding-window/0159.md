## Question

> Given a string s, return the length of the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters.

Input: s = "eceba" \  
Output: 3 \
Explanation: The substring is "ece" which its length is 3.

## Intuition

Use hash table and keep it at size = 2

- once it's > 2, shrink the window by moving the left pointer char from hash table
- by now, it's already has at most 2 unique char in current window, record max length

## Code

**Time:** O(n) \
**Space:** O(1)

```java
public int lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(String s) {
    int longest = 0;

    Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0, right = 0;

    while (right < s.length()) {
        char c = s.charAt(right++);
        map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0)+1);

        while (map.size() > 2) {
            c = s.charAt(left++);
            map.put(c, map.get(c)-1);
            if (map.get(c) == 0)
                map.remove(c);
        }

        longest = Math.max(longest, right-left);
    }

    return longest;
}
```
