## Question

> Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]\
Output: 2\
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

## Intuition

It's to return any of the peaks, so the goal is find the rightmost peak.

```java
1,2,1,3,5,6,4
  ^       ^
```

As we can see, both 2 and 6 are the peak value. In order to know the it's a peak, compare with its left, if it's greater, it might be the peak, so we have to keep searching to the right until no more value is greater than the left.

## Code

**Time:** O(log n)\
**Space:** O(1)

```java
public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
    int low = 0, high = nums.length-1;

    while (low < high) {
        int mid = low + (high-low)/2;
        if (nums[mid] < nums[mid+1])
            low = mid+1;
        else
            high = mid;
    }

    return low;
}
```
