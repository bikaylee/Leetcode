### Question

> Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array if you can flip at most `k` `0`'s.

Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2  
Output: 6  
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]  
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

<br>

### Intuition

1. within the current window, keep count for the flips (the number of zeros)
2. once flips > k, shrink the window until it satisfies flips == k
3. update max if current window size is greater, after step 2, the window is always valid

### Code

**Time:** O(n)  
**Space:** O(1)

```java
public int longestOnes(int[] nums, int k) {
    int flips = 0;
    int ans = 0;

    int left = 0, right = 0;
    while (right < nums.length) {
        if (nums[right++] == 0)
            flips++;

        while (flips > k) {
            if (nums[left++] == 0)
                flips--;
        }
        ans = Math.max(ans, right-left);
    }

    return ans;
}
```
