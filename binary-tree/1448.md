## Question

> Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]  
Output: 4  
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.  
Root Node (3) is always a good node.  
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.  
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path  
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.

## Intuition

Use DFS (Depth First Search) to traverse the tree, and constantly keep track of the current path maximum.

## Code

**Time:** O(n)  
**Space:** O(n)

Recursive

```java
int ans = 0;
public int goodNodes(TreeNode root) {
    helper(root, root.val);
    return ans;
}

private void helper(TreeNode root, int max) {
    if (root == null)
        return;

    if (root.val >= max) {
        max = root.val;
        ans++;
    }

    helper(root.left, max);
    helper(root.right, max);
}
```
