## Question

> Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]\
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]

## Intuition

1. Create two list, append to each list if it qualifies its condition.
2. Connect the even list after the odd list

## Code

**Time:** O(n)\
**Space:** O(1)

```java
public ListNode oddEvenList(ListNode head) {
    ListNode odd = head, even = head.next;
    ListNode evenHead = even;

    while (even != null && even.next != null) {
        odd.next = even.next;
        odd = odd.next;
        even.next = odd.next;
        even = even.next;
    }
    odd.next = evenHead.next;
    return head;
}
```
