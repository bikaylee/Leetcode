## Question

> Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2\
Output: [1,2,3,5]

## Intuition

Used two pointer

- the distance between the node and null is n+1, where the node is the predecessor of the to be deleted node
- iterate both pointers at the same speed
- set the predecessor pointing to the successor

## Code

**Time:** O(n)\
**Space:** O(1)

```java
public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
    ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
    ListNode prev = dummy;
    ListNode curr = head;
    while (n-- > 0)
        curr = curr.next;

    while (curr != null) {
        prev = prev.next;
        curr = curr.next;
    }

    if (prev.next != null)
        prev.next = prev.next.next;
    return dummy.next;
}
```
