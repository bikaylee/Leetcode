## Question

> Return the number of strings in words that contain pref as a prefix.

Input: words = ["pay","attention","practice","attend"], pref = "at" \
Output: 2\
Explanation: The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: "attention" and "attend".

## Intuition

Straightforward

- iterate the words array and compare each word with pref at pref's length

## Code

**Time:** O(n)\
**Space:** o(1)

```java
public int prefixCount(String[] words, String pref) {
    int len = pref.length();
    int ans = 0;
    for (String word: words) {
        if (word.length() >= len)
            ans += word.substring(0, len).equals(pref) ? 1:0;
    }
    return ans;
}
```
